    "# Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks\n",
    "A RBF network is an alternative to a Feedforward neural network, and it mixes ideas from unsupervised and supervised learning. A RBF network for a C classes classification problem is based on K prototypes, such that the classification depends on the __distance__ between the point and the K prototypes. A RBF network consists in 3 layers as shown in the following [figure](https://mccormickml.com/2013/08/15/radial-basis-function-network-rbfn-tutorial/):\n",
