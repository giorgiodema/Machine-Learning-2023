    "## IPython\n",
    "IPython is a python interpreter with some additional features, the most important one is the Decoupled two-process model. The standard python interpreter implements a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL), that is an infinite loop that reads the input command, executes the command and prints the output to the standard output. The IPython interpreter instead decouples the evaluation into its own process, called **kernel**. A kernel receives the commands from the clients and communicates the results back to them."
